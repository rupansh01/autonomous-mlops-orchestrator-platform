# Autonomous MLOps Orchestration Platform

## Overview
This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be trained,
evaluated, versioned, and promoted automatically without manual intervention.
The system focuses on safe and controlled MLOps automation using workflow
orchestration and experiment tracking.

## Problem Statement
In many organizations, model retraining and deployment are manual and error-prone.
This leads to inconsistent results, lack of traceability, and risky production
deployments. The goal of this project is to automate the entire MLOps lifecycle
while enforcing quality and safety checks.

## System Architecture
Webhook → n8n → Training API → Evaluation → MLflow Tracking → Model Promotion

## Key Features
- Automated model retraining triggered by events
- Metric-based evaluation and validation
- Model versioning and promotion using MLflow
- Safe deployment with rollback capability
- Fully auditable experiment history

## Tech Stack
- Python
- FastAPI
- n8n (workflow orchestration)
- MLflow (experiment tracking & model registry)

## Use Case
Applicable to systems where models need frequent retraining, such as
recommendation systems, forecasting pipelines, or analytics platforms.
